In a nutshell, what this means is that we can use images of your wedding for promotional purposes, but we choose to always seek permission first out of respect for your privacy. This includes hosting pictures as an example of past jobs on our website for future clients to see and submitting shots to photography contests/wedding magazines/blogs and the like. We are also happy to sell prints to you and your guests. Of course, we can always discuss and come to a solution that leaves everyone happy if you are uncomfortable with us using images of your day for promotional purposes.

You can certainly share images of your wedding with friends and family as you’d expect, you can print off photos for personal use, and build your own wedding album as a few examples - you simply can’t profit from them. It also means that you cannot submit those photos to contests/wedding magazines/blogs and so on (if you’d like to do those things, just let us know and we’d be more than happy to submit them for you). It also means that since we hold copyright, we ask that you please not edit any images - that’s what we’re here for and that service is included in the fee you pay. Just let us know if you’d like a particular treatment - it’s our job, after all!

The shots are already well-composed, so our main task in editing is colour-balancing and reducing the high number of photos to a manageable gallery for you by removing doubles. We will occasionally fine-tune a photo that say, had a stranger rambling through the background, but we do not feel that extensive editing is necessary, or desired, in most cases. We will never assume and photoshop someone’s appearance, but if you’ve been bitten by a monster mosquito and would like that bug bite on your forehead edited out please let us know - we will not do this without your request. </p>

What we need from you are details if the family shots will deviate from the standard - for example, if the groom’s parents are divorced and would rather take separate shots with their new partners, if someone’s grandmother has a condition which means she should be in the first round of pictures so that she can leave to rest, etc… Just what, exactly, “the standard” is is something we will be certain to cover with you.

Bearing that in mind, it always helps to really take a good look at the picture and imagine it in your chosen venue - is it possible? We can always recreate the actions, but sometimes certain shots just don’t have the same appeal if the setting is drastically different. That being said, once all the official photos are done (and they are important - when was the last time your entire family was in one spot at the same time?) we encourage you to have fun.
